## About Project

I created my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to create sites and showcase my previous work. Furthermore, I implemented Material UI for the first time, was able to make the site accessible and responsive to all screen sizes.\
I leveraged external libraries to create smooth scrolling on the site and implement a typewriter animation
