        <p>
          I am a Software Developer who through enthusiasm and self-motivation
          has learnt to code whilst working full time. I am competent in several
          coding languages including React and JavaScript, and am continuing to
          further my learning. I have proven my skills through developing
          projects such as a React weather app which you can find linked below.
          Currently Iâ€™m seeking a long-term position where I can utilise my
          transferable skills such as problem solving and data analysis; and
          develop my skills.
