      <p>
        I am a Software Developer who through enthusiasm and self-motivation has
        learnt to code whilst working full time. I am competent in several
        coding languages including React and JavaScript, and am continuing to
        further my learning. I have proven my skills through developing projects
        such as a React weather app which you can find linked below. Currently
        Iâ€™m seeking a long-term position where I can utilise my transferable
        skills such as problem solving and data analysis; and develop my skills.
