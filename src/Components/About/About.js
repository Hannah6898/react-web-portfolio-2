              Iâ€™m Hannah, a Software Developer based in Kent currently looking
              for my first junior developer role.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began learning to code at the beginning of this year and found
              the process of learning new technologies and creating solutions to
              difficult problems both exciting and rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
              My long-term goal is to be able to efficiently turn great ideas
              into functioning products thorough absorbing as much as I can from
              those my senior and become the best developer I can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I like to roller skate, watch TV and movies, and
              watch Formula 1.
